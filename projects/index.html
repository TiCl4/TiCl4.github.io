        <li><a href="https://ticl4.github.io/Neighborhood_Map/">Neighborhood Map - JavaScript (live demontration)</a>
            <br>
            <span>-	Built a neighborhood map of where I live using Google Maps API, Foursquare API and JSON to get data from the servers to include detail about popular locations that I think people would want to visit if they have a chance to visit Portland, OR.</span>
            <br>
            <span>-	Assembled KnockoutJS (a JavaScript library) into my project code to implement search algorithm in which they can search for specific locations displayed on the menu.</span>
            <br>
            <span>-	Designed the web to work well in mobile environments as I applied a hamburger button to hide the location menu if the screen size is small.</span>
            <br>
            <span>-	Designed a click function that when a location (or marker) is clicked, an information window will display and the associated marker on the map will change colors to appear active.</span>

        <li><a href="https://ticl4.github.io/Classic_Arcade_Game_Clone/">Classic Arcade Game Clone - JavaScript (live demontration)</a>
            <br>
            <span>-	Built an arcade game clone that uses object oriented JavaScript to manipulate objects in the game such as player and bugs.</span>
            <br>
            <span>-	Programmed functions for arrow keys that the player can manipulate to lead "player" across lanes full of bugs to the other side to win.</span>
            <br>
            <span>-	Applied rules for the game that if player and a bug collide, the game is reset and the player is put back to the original position to start the game again.</span>
